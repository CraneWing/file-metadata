File Metadata Microservice

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-back-end-development-projects.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
  User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
   User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

Hint: You may want to use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer
Here is a tut on using multer, a Node module that enables Express to have file uploading. And metadata is returned too!
